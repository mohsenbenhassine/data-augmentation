We introduces the Empirical Copula Generator, a novel non-parametric method for generating synthetic datasets that preserve the statistical properties of original data while ensuring privacy. It addresses the critical need for high-fidelity synthetic data in domains like healthcare, finance, and social sciences, where data scarcity and confidentiality constraints often hinder analysis. Through extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets—such as Adult, Ecoli, Forest Fires, and Wisconsin Breast Cancer—the article demonstrates the generator’s ability to maintain marginal and joint distributions with exceptional accuracy (e.g., JS Divergence of 0.0292 for Wisconsin). By offering a robust, versatile tool for data augmentation and privacy-preserving research, this work bridges the gap between data availability and statistical integrity, paving the way for enhanced machine learning applications and future methodological advancements.
The real world datasets are described alongwith code in files: Forest Fires Dataset,wdbc Dataset,ecoli and census.
